## Overview

Intro component with sign up form challenge on Frontend Mentor

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the `form` is submitted if:
  - Any `input` field is empty. The message for this error should say *"[Field Name] cannot be empty"*
  - The email address is not formatted correctly (i.e. a correct email address should have this structure: `name@host.tld`). The message for this error should say *"Looks like this is not an email"*

## My process

I created the page using grid and Flexbox. I used grid in demarcating the 2 parts of the page, then I used Flexbox in constructing the form and also the part above the form because I didn't want a fixed height on the "Try it" item above the form.
After setting up, I found it a bit difficult with the javascript due to the requirements of the project but I was able to pull it off successfully.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned so much from this project, especially as regards the responsiveness of the page. I learned about the best situations to use grid and flexbox interchangeably. It is my first form project on Frontend Mentor so I really learned a lot about forms.

I think the aspect I learned most is the javascript. It is also my first javascript project on Frontend Mentor. It was a really tedious task getting to make sure the error message popped out along with the icon and the event listener. It was a really great experience and I enjoyed every bit of it.

```js
const spans = formControl.querySelectorAll("span:not(:last-child)");
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
I never knew an element could be selected this way in javascript.
```

### Continued development

I hope to code more on javascript. The challenge is really exciting.

### Useful resources

- [W3 SCHOOLS](https://www.w3schools.com) - A very good website for all kinds of development resources. There can't be any better.
- [CSS GENERATOR](https://https://cssgenerator.org/box-shadow-css-generator.html) - This is a great site for generating great CSS styling. I was able to generate my box shadow using them.
